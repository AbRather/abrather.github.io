  details: 'This research project aims to provide a reliable way to improve the quality and durability of CFRP components for use in challenging cryogenic environments.
   The combination of experimental testing and simulation enables a well-founded analysis of how manufacturing processes interact with the structural performance of CFRP under 
   cryogenic conditions. By comparing the simulation and test results, this project work provided a deep understanding of how material design and structural configuration can 
   be made better to minimize microcrack formation. The findings served as a crucial guide for the future design and engineering of cryo-safe CFRP structures, ensuring their 
   durability and reliability for the next generation of hydrogen technology applications.
    <br>
   This research investigates the micromechanical behavior and damage evolution of a 
   high-performance Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite subjected to extreme 
   cryogenic thermal cycling. Using Abaqus/Standard and Python scripting, a 3D Representative Volume Element (RVE) 
   with a variable fiber volume fraction was generated to simulate a cryogenic thermal cycle. 
   The simulation explicitly models the fiber-matrix interface using cohesive elements to 
   capture debonding and micro-cracking phenomena driven by the significant mismatch in the 
   Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) between the fiber and the matrix. The model incorporates 
   Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs) to ensure the RVE accurately represents the bulk material behavior.

  details: 'Efficient thermal management is critical for the reliability of modern high-power electronic systems. This project series investigated three distinct passive cooling strategies to quantify their impact on heat dissipation rates. 
   The first phase focused on <strong>Phase Change Thermal Management</strong>, analyzing the performance of Heat Pipes. By characterizing the two-phase flow mechanism (evaporation and condensation), the study demonstrated how utilizing the latent heat of vaporization allows for an effective thermal conductivity that significantly outperforms solid copper conductors.
    <br>
   The second phase explored <strong>Geometric Optimization</strong> through a parametric study of extended surfaces (fins). The experiment isolated the effects of orientation (vertical vs. horizontal) on natural convection, quantifying the variation in the convective heat transfer coefficient (h) to determine optimal heat sink configurations driven by buoyancy effects.
    <br>
   The final phase investigated <strong>Passive Turbulence Induction</strong>. By introducing controlled surface roughness using wire mesh overlays, the study analyzed the disruption of the thermal boundary layer. The results showed a direct correlation between surface irregularity and an increased Nusselt number, proving that tripping the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent effectively enhances the overall heat transfer rate without active energy input.'
